# Collaborative-Filtering-Recommender-System
I have implemented the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings (MovieLens 100k Dataset from GroupLens Research). This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset has $n_u = 943$ users, and $n_m = 1682$ movies.  In the next parts of this exercise, you will implement the function cofiCostFunc that computes the collaborative filtering objective function and gradient. After implementing the cost function and gradient, you will use scipy.optimize.minimize to learn the parameters for collaborative filtering.
