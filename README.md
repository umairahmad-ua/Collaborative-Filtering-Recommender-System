# Collaborative-Filtering-Recommender-System
I have implemented the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings (MovieLens 100k Dataset from GroupLens Research). This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset has $n_u = 943$ users, and $n_m = 1682$ movies.  I have implemented the algorthim from the scrath for COST and Loss function that computes the collaborative filtering objective function and gradient. After implementing the cost function and gradient, I have used scipy.optimize.minimize to learn the parameters for collaborative filtering. The code was done by appling Regularization and without Regularization.

### Download the Dataset (MovieLens 100k Dataset from GroupLens Research) 
### Please Uncomment For training 
### Provide the model with helping files
### Testing , We will only load the pretrained Model no retraining
